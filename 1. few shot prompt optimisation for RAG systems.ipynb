    "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an approach that allows LLMs to tap into a large corpus of knowledge from sources and query its knowledge store to find relevant passages/content and produce a well-refined response.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG ensures LLMs can dynamically utilize real-time knowledge even if not originally trained on the subject and give thoughtful answers. DSpy provides a compiler architecture to optimise a prompt (aka teleprompers) which offer various tradeoffs in terms of how much they optimise cost versus quality. This example demonstrates a simple default BootstrapFewShot Optimiser."
